    Fail-safe: close a request task when its return task is submitted.

    The problem it solves: the agent that does the work is not the agent that closes the
    record of it. A build agent submits an audit request targeting `security`; security
    files the audit and submits a return task; nobody closes the request, because the build
    agent is not its target agent and may not update it. 14 audit tasks accumulated that way
    between 2026-07-19 and 2026-08-15.

    Fires only on the *return shape*: the new task must be addressed back to whoever asked.

        parent.target_agent == new.source_agent    # I did the parent's work
        parent.source_agent == new.target_agent    # and I am answering the asker

    BOTH are required, and the second one is not optional bookkeeping — it is the fix for a
    bug this feature shipped with. `originating_task_id` is overloaded: it means "inherit
    workflow_mode from this parent" on a *forward* request as much as "this is the return
    for that request" on a return. `shared-build-pre-audit` Step 4 has always told the build
    agent to pass its own build task when submitting the audit request, purely for
    workflow_mode inheritance. Under the first condition alone that looks identical to a
    return — parent build task targets developer, developer submits — so the very first
    audit request filed after v0.6.0 shipped auto-closed its own in-flight build task, and
    terminal tasks are immutable, so it could not be reopened. (2026-08-16, live.)

    Checking the pair distinguishes them: a genuine return is symmetric (audit task
    developer→security, return security→developer), while a forward request is not
    (build task research→developer, request developer→security — `research != security`).

    The first condition is also what keeps this from being a cross-agent close primitive —
    agent A naming agent B's task as its parent must not close it. It is checked here
    explicitly rather than relying on update_task_handler's ownership check, which also
    admits OPERATOR_ACTOR: a caller submitting as source_agent="operator" would otherwise be
    able to close anyone's task.

    Deliberately narrower than "any non-terminal parent" (see AUTO_CLOSE_FROM_STATUSES).

    Returns the parent's id if it was closed, else None. Never raises — the auto-close is a
    convenience, and a failure here must not fail the submit that triggered it.

# get_task) and mutations on archived tasks were refused, but the mover lived in
# upstream's task-dispatcher, which this fork deliberately does not run. The
# result on every deployment was a queue directory that only ever grew: terminal
# tasks stayed in the default view forever (ttl_days is a display filter, the
# file remains), every read re-parsed them, and .locks/ accumulated one file per
# task with no cleanup at all.
#
# The writer side lives HERE, not in a client with an rw mount, because this
# module owns the directory: the per-task flock protocol, the atomic-write
# convention, and the uid the volume belongs to. A second YAML writer outside
# this process is exactly what the control API exists to prevent.
