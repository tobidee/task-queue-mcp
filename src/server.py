# These routes are NOT behind the MCP bearer auth added in v0.7.0 — custom_route
# handlers bypass the transport's auth provider — so TASK_QUEUE_API_SECRET remains
# their only gate. Until v0.7.0 that sentence read as though an MCP auth middleware
# already existed; it did not, and the tool path was open (vikunja#387). It does now,
# and these routes are deliberately outside it: they are the operator surface, and the
# operator identity is reachable from here and nowhere else.
#
# Note this gate contains mistakes rather than intent: wherever an agent holds a shell
# tool and runs as the OS user that owns the secret file, it can read the secret. Closing
# that needs per-agent OS users or a credential broker, not a change here.

# it would have to be given its own path, deliberately.
